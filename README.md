# Compressive Strength of concrete

It is a project of predicting the Compressive Strength of the concrete First of all we perform the EDA and after that we tried the different different models such as:

*	Random Forest --> 87.30%
*	Random Forest Regressor k_fold --> 76.17%
*	Gradient Boost Regressor --> 88.02%
*	Gradient Boost Regressor k fold -->	76.96%
*	Ada Boosting Regressor --> 75.73%
*	Ada Boosting Regressor k fold --> 59.56%
*	KNN Regressor --> 75.38%
*	KNN Regressor k fold --> 69.07%
*	Bagging Regressor --> 85.12%
*	Bagging Regressor k fold --> 73.48%
*	Support Vector Regressor --> 65.49%
*	SVR k fold --> 66.72%
*	XGBoost --> 90.04%
*	Decision Tree --> 74.72%
*	Decision Tree k fold --> 66.42%
*	Decision Tree2 --> 73.93%
*	Pruned Decision Tree --> 55.68%
*	Pruned Decision Tree k fold --> 44.79%

: ```Gradient Boost Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Bagging Regressor``` and ```Random Forest``` seems to do well in the scenario. We can choose either of them.


## To See Analyse of the data
run a jupyter notebook
```
run a Concrete Strength.ipynb
```
## Deployment
Prepare your dataset:
```
1. Data Extraction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building and Tuning
6. Pushing code to Github
```
